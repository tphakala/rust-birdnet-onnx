            Perform a security review of this pull request. Focus on:

            1. **Input validation**: Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, path traversal)
            2. **Memory safety**: Look for potential buffer overflows, use-after-free (though Rust prevents most)
            3. **Error handling**: Ensure errors don't leak sensitive information
            4. **Dependencies**: Flag any suspicious or unnecessary dependencies
            5. **Unsafe code**: This crate denies unsafe code - flag any attempts to use it
            6. **File operations**: Check for path traversal or symlink attacks
            7. **Cryptography**: Flag any weak or custom crypto implementations

            Only report actual security concerns, not style issues.
            Be concise and specific about the vulnerability and its impact.
