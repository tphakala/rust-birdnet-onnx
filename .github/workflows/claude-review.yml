            Review this PR for a Rust library (birdnet-onnx). Focus on:

            1. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, error handling
            2. **Safety**: No unsafe code allowed (denied in Cargo.toml)
            3. **Performance**: ONNX inference is performance-critical
            4. **API Design**: Public API should be ergonomic and well-documented
            5. **Testing**: Are changes adequately tested?

            Style rules (from Cargo.toml lints):
            - pedantic clippy enabled
            - no unwrap/expect/panic in library code
            - no print_stdout/print_stderr in library code

            Be concise. Only comment on issues worth fixing.
            Praise is not needed - focus on problems.
